# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description

This project was created during Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course. It is the culmination of the Front-End Development Track.

The website showcases the implementation of a booking application on the Little Lemon Website. It was created with React components to demonstrate an understanding of using React for web development. Additionally, it features the use of API calls.

**Please note:** The only functionality working on this website besides the design is the Reserve a Table function.
