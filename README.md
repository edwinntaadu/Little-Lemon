# Little Lemon Booking Website

## Project Description

Developed during Meta's Coursera Front-End Development course, the Little Lemon Booking Website showcases a booking application built with React components. This project demonstrates the use of React for web development and includes API call integrations. While the main functionality revolves around the "Reserve a Table" feature, the project highlights the design and interactive aspects of a modern web application.

**Please note:** The only functionality working on this website besides the design is the Reserve a Table function.
